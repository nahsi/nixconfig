# Skill mechanics

The skill-specific branch of [`writing-for-agents`](SKILL.md): what changes when the document is a skill (frontmatter, the invocation choice, and router skills). Everything else about writing it is the universal reference in `SKILL.md`.

## Invocation

Two choices, trading the two loads:

- A **model-invoked** skill keeps a `description`, so the agent can fire it autonomously, and other skills can reach it. You can still type its name: model-invocation always _includes_ user reach; a description only ever adds agent discovery, never removes the human's. The description is the skill's top-level context pointer, forced to stay loaded at all times: permanent context load in exchange for discoverability. A model-invoked skill whose content is all reference is also one home for shared reference: another skill can invoke it, so reference needed by several skills lives in one place. Mechanics: omit `disable-model-invocation`, and write a model-facing description carrying the trigger branches (the pointer-writing rules in `SKILL.md` apply in full).
- A **user-invoked** skill omits its description from the model-visible catalog. The user can invoke it by name, and an agent can read it through an explicit `skill://<name>` reference from the user or another skill. There is no always-loaded description cost; selection belongs to the human or the referring document. Mechanics: set `disable-model-invocation: true`; the `description` becomes human-facing: a one-line summary, trigger lists stripped.

Pick model-invocation when the agent must discover the skill from task intent. Use user-invocation when users or explicit pointers select it. A reference from another skill does not require model-invocation.

Shared reference can live in a sibling skill or a plain file. Give each consuming skill an explicit read pointer.

## Splitting by invocation

The invocation cut of splitting (the sequence cut lives in `SKILL.md`): split off a model-invoked skill when you have a distinct leading word that should trigger it on its own (a trigger word you actually use in your prompts). You pay context load for the new always-loaded description, so that independent discovery has to be worth it. A leaf reached only through explicit pointers can remain user-invoked.

## Router skills

When user-invoked skills multiply past what you can remember, that piled-up cognitive load is cured by a **router skill**: one user-invoked skill that names the others and when to reach for each, so the human has one skill to remember instead of many. Its body supplies explicit `skill://<name>` read pointers for the relevant branches. The leaf skills can remain hidden from automatic discovery.
